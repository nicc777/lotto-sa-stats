# Lotto SA Stats

This is a evolving project I use to learn about stats.

I base my learning on data from the South African lottery.

This is for personal development and not meant to be used in any real world project. Thing may (and probably will) break.

At the time of writing this README, I am still busy putting together the Domain Model.
